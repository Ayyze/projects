A simple automation to display the Linux operating system information:
1. OS version
2. Public IP, private IP, & default gateway
3. Hard disk size; free and used space
4. Top five directories and their sizes
5. CPU usage

The first attempt was done in Bash script, before creating a version in Python subsequently.
